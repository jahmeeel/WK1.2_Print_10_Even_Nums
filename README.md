# Week 1-4: Print 10 Even Numbers Exercise

## Problem Statement:
The goal of this program is to print the first 10 even numbers. My initial approach to the problem was to define a function that contains a for loop that iterates through a given range of numbers and outputs only the even numbers within that range.

## Learnings:
After analyzing the problem statement, I realized that a simple range() function can be used with its parameters to set the range of numbers to iterate over and the step to take between each number. After using the range() function, I looped through the numbers and only printed the even ones using an if statement.

By taking this approach, I was able to learn more about the range() function and how it can be used with its parameters to set a specific range and increment between each number. This approach was more efficient and helped me to think critically about the problem and find the simplest solution.

## Future improvements:
While this solution was simple and effective for this specific problem, there may be more complex problems in the future where defining a separate function may be necessary. With that in mind, I learned that it's important to keep in mind that each problem requires its unique solution, and sometimes a simple approach is the best one.
